# 📲 Flix Favorites 🍿

### Overview

Flix Favorites allows users to save their favorite movies and view them in a "favorites" list on a separate tab. To do this, I leveraged *User Defaults* to save and retrieve movies from the app's local storage. Adding a tab bar was done using a *Tab Bar Controller*.
